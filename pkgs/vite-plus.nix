# TODO: Once official nixpkgs support (NixOS/nixpkgs#533925) is merged, switch
# to pkgs.vite-plus and delete this file, pkgs/vite-plus-runtime and the
# nvfetcher entry.
#
# `vp` is only the Rust launcher. Every subcommand that does real work (dev,
# build, test, check, lint, fmt, create, migrate, ...) is handed to a
# JavaScript toolchain that vp resolves at <prefix>/node_modules/vite-plus,
# relative to the resolved path of the executable. Installing the launcher on
# its own leaves all of them dying with "Cannot find module" (issue #413), so
# the npm dependency tree is built here and installed next to it.
#
# The approach is taken from https://github.com/ryoppippi/nix-vite-plus, which
# worked this out first and documents the parts that are not obvious until you
# hit them. Deviations from it are noted where they occur.
